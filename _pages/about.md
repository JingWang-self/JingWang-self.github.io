<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Visual Technology](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Ruiqin Xiong](https://xiongrq.github.io/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Fuqiang Gu](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/gufq/zh_CN/index.htm) on the topic of robotics/SLAM.

- Our work, SAMPLE, enables large vision-language models like CLIP to perform event-based open-vocabulary action recognition. By pioneering a Temporal-Adaptive Multimodal Prompt Learning strategy, it efficiently bridges the domain gap from static images to dynamic event streams while preserving generalization for unseen actions. This establishes a new state-of-the-art across all tested scenarios, from fully-supervised to zero-shot settings.
